Full Stack Development
At Coding Dojo, you will learn to become a full stack developer in three different languages! But what does it mean to be a full stack developer? A full stack is the culmination of all of the different phases of web development: the front-end, the back-end, and the database. Being proficient in each of those areas is what makes a full stack developer! So let's talk about how each of those pieces will come together in the following months.

##The Front End
The Front End, also referred to as the client-side, is where the user interacts with your web application - you are looking at the front end right now! Remember that no matter what language you are using on the back end, front end development will always use the same three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So whether you are building a website using Ruby on Rails, Python with Django or PHP with CodeIgniter, the front end portion of your application will always be HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! However, keep in mind that front end development is not only writing markup text with some styling! JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS, and BackboneJS require quite a bit of code and allow for front end developers to create extremely complex, interactive and dynamic web applications!

##The Back End
The Back End, also referred to as the server-side, is where all (not really all but most) of your logic will live. We know a little bit about the Request and Response Cycle, so you probably know that a client accesses a web page by first requesting some content. Then the server accepts the request and responds with the appropriate content. Everything that happens on the server-side between the accepted request and the delivered response is what we call back end development! Python, Ruby, and PHP are some examples of commonly used back-end languages. One of the main concerns of back-end development will be retrieving data to return to the client. So where are we getting that data from? And how are we getting it? Well, the database of course!

##The Database
The Database is the final component of full stack development. The database is simply a collection of information that is organized so that it can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. When you register an account for a new website or mobile application, you are essentially creating a new entry in that application's database. If you decide to update your password, you are essentially updating the password column in that application's database. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for making interactive queries from a database. There are relational databases, non-relational databases, NoSQL databases, ORMs (Object Relational Mappings), but more on those in your upcoming stacks!
