# Web Development Fundamentals 1
## Introduction:
What exactly is the World Wide Web? We use it every day, but we may not fully understand exactly what it is and how it works. 
Have you been looking for a way to break into the web development industry as a web developer, designer, or web programmer? The Web Development Fundamentals 1 Workshop is designed to quickly introduce you to current web development technology and provide you with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS. You'll also learn exactly how the internet works; about clients, servers, protocols and the next steps you need to take you to the next level on the web. During the workshop you will create a static HTML web page that can be used as your first online portfolio.
